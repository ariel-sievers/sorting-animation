# sorting-animation

Visualize several sorting algorithms with this application.

# Running (requires Node)

First, download the project files. Then go to the root of the project within a command line and type in the command `node server.js`.

The application should run on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000) with the ability to change the number of elements, sorting speed, sorting order, and sorting type.
You may also pause/start the algorithm with buttons on the lower right, as well as shuffle the elements in a different order.

# Demo

If you don't want to download the project, you can play with it here: https://sortinganimation.netlify.app/.

# References

This project was heavily inspired from another user's project: https://github.com/Aaron-Bird/ivy. Hence, there are a lot of similarities
in design and functionality. Similarly, some features of my application were changed due to implementation and personalization.

Some sorting algorithms found on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) were used as a reference as well.
