# sorting-animation
Visualize several sorting algorithms with this application.

# Running (requires Node)
First, download the project files. Then go to the root of the project within a command line and type in the command `node server.js`.
The application should run in your default browser with the ability to change the number of elements, sorting speed, sorting order, and sorting type.
You may also pause/start the algorithm with buttons on the lower right, as well as shuffle the elements in a different order.

# Available Sorting Algorithms
Currently the sorting algorithms you may choose from include: 
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort

# References
This project was heavily inspired from another user's project: https://github.com/Aaron-Bird/ivy. Hence, there are a lot of similarities
in design and functionality. Similarly, some features of my application were changed due to implementation and personalization.

Some sorting algorithms found on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) were used as a reference as well.
